```{r, eval=TRUE}
rpsmat <- matrix(NA, nrow=250, ncol=250)

```

death and replacement probabilities



 put out initial outlay - start at equal abundances (from Fig.1 line graphs)

 do one generation of updates - update matrix and frequencies of each cell type

for loop for updating

 save frequencies at each generation

 figure out how to save matricies every N generations (in a list?)

 work with neighborhood sizes
